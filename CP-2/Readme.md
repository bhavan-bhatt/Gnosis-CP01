## The data was given to us in the form of a kaggle link but it was generated as part of the Avast AIC laboratory with the funding of Avast Software. We have implemented 5 different classical Machine Learning models and tried to solve 2 problems. First was of detecting whether there was any attack or not and second was identifying which type of attack was there. While solving the problem of binary classification we used LinearSVC as well as Lightgbm which acts as perfect example with respect to increase in model's complexity. While solving the problem of multiclass classification we used Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes as well as Xgboost and the accuracy was increasing the same order. We as a team have faced a lot of challenges due to the size of data and 25 Million instances, this was another reason why we decided to use some unique strategies.
